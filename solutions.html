   Security couldn't make more sense without an electric perimeter fence installation coupled with  razor wire to ward off individuals of questionable character who want to jump over your fence and reap from where they never sowed. 
   Long gone are the days when perimeter walls were decorated with broken glasses that gave false hope to home owners and made them imagine that they were safe. 
   We do wall top electric fence installation for perimeter walls and free standing electric fence for compounds without any form of fencing. 
   We employ the use of all types of electric fence energizers including those that allow you to pin point the exact location (zone) where a fault is originating from thus allowing for easy troubleshooting.
